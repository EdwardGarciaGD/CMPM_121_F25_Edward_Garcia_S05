# Section 5 â€“ Refactoring Code Smells in Practice

A code smell that I noticed right off the bat is the naming of the variables.
I changed the naming of the count "c" int "countTracker" and removed the comment of it.
I also changed the names of the HTML elements because of their vagueness.

Another code smell that I have seen was the redudant code inside the clickable button events.
I converted all of the code into a function for clarity.

Another code smell I have seen is too many comments on some code that seems not important to have another programmer understand.
I removed some unwanted comments to be more readable for other programmers.
